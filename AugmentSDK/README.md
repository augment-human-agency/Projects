AugmentFPGA: AI Execution on Any Hardware
📌 Run AI Models Without GPUs – FPGA, CPU, & Legacy Systems

🚀 AI Model Deployment Without Hardware Lock-In
Welcome to AugmentFPGA, an execution framework that removes hardware barriers for AI inference.

💡 What This Does:
✅ Runs AI inference on FPGAs, CPUs, and low-power devices without dedicated GPUs.
✅ Dynamically adapts AI execution to match available hardware resources.
✅ Hardware-Agnostic – Deploy once, run anywhere.

🔑 Key Features
1️⃣ AI Execution Without GPUs
🔹 Supports ONNX-based models (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.).
🔹 Runs AI inference on FPGA, CPU, & alternative accelerators.
🔹 Ideal for low-power & embedded devices.

2️⃣ AI "Emulator" for Model Portability
🔹 Convert any AI model into an FPGA-compatible execution format.
🔹 Dynamically reconfigures execution based on hardware availability.
🔹 Eliminates vendor lock-in (no CUDA, no TensorRT restrictions).

3️⃣ FPGA as a Universal AI Accelerator
🔹 AI models can be recompiled on-the-fly for different hardware.
🔹 Memory & compute optimization for efficient execution.
🔹 Supports batch processing & quantization for performance.
